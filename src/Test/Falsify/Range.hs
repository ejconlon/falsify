  Skew

  To introduce skew, we want something that is reasonably simply to implement
  but also has some reasonal properties. Suppose a skew of @s@ means that we
  generate value from the lower 20% of the range 60% of the time. Then:

  - Symmetry around the antidiagonal: we will generate a value from the
    upper 60% of the range 20% of the time.

  - Symmetry around the diagonal: a skew of @-s@ will mean we generate a value
    from the /upper/ 20% of the range 60% of the time.

  To derive the formula we use, suppose we start with a circle with radius 1,
  centered at the origin:

  > x^2 + y^2 == 1
  >       y^2 == 1 - x^2
  >       y   == (1 - x^2) ^ (1/2)

  In the interval [0, 1] this gives us the upper right quadrant of the circle,
  but we want the lower right:

  > y == 1 - ((1 - x^2) ^ (1/2))

  We can now vary that power.

  > y == 1 - ((1 - x^3) ^ (1/3))
  > y == 1 - ((1 - x^4) ^ (1/4))
  > ..

  If the power is 1, we get no skew:

  > y == 1 - ((1 - x^1) ^ (1/1))
  >   == 1 - (1 - x)
  >   == x

  We want a skew of 0 to mean no skew, so in terms of s:

  > y == 1 - ((1 - x^(s+1)) ^ (1/(s+1)))

  For negative values of @s@, we flip this around the diagonal:

  > y == 1 - (1 - ((1 - (1-x)^(s+1)) ^ (1/(s+1))))
  >   ==           (1 - (1-x)^(s+1)) ^ (1/(s+1))

  giving us

  > (1 - (1 - x)^2)^(1/2)  for s == -1
  > (1 - (1 - x)^3)^(1/3)  for s == -2
  > etc.

-- | Introduce skew (non-uniform selection)
--
-- A skew of @s == 0@ means no skew: uniform selection.
--
-- A positive skew @(s > 0)@ introduces a bias towards smaller values (this is
-- the typical use case). As example, for a skew of @s == 1@:
--
-- * We will generate a value from the lower 20% of the range 60% of the time.
-- * We will generate a value from the upper 60% of the range 20% of the time.
--
-- A negative skew @(s < 0)@ introduces a bias towards larger values. For a
-- skew of @s == 1@:
--
-- * We will generate a value from the upper 20% of the range 60% of the time.
-- * We will generate a value from the lower 60% of the range 20% of the time.
--
-- The table below lists values for the percentage of the range used, given a
-- percentage of the time (a value of 0 means a single value from the range):
--
-- >    | time%
-- >  s | 50% | 90%
-- > --------------
-- >  0 |  50 |  90
-- >  1 |  13 |  56
-- >  2 |   4 |  35
-- >  3 |   1 |  23
-- >  4 |   0 |  16
-- >  5 |   0 |  11
-- >  6 |   0 |   8
-- >  7 |   0 |   6
-- >  8 |   0 |   5
-- >  9 |   0 |   4
-- > 10 |   0 |   3
--
-- Will shrink towards @x@, independent of skew.
--
-- NOTE: The implementation currently uses something similar to Î¼-law encoding.
-- As a consequence, the generator gets increased precision near the end of the
-- range we skew towards, and less precision near the other end. This means that
-- not all values in the range can be produced.
